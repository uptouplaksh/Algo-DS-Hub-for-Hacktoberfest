            Our automated check has detected that your branch is **${commitsCount} commit(s) behind** our \`main\` branch. This can lead to merge conflicts and may cause issues during the review process.
            
            ### 🔄 How to fix this:
            
            To sync your fork and merge the latest changes from \`main\` into your branch, please follow these steps:
            
            #### Option 1: Using GitHub UI (Easiest)
            1. Go to your fork on GitHub
            2. Click on "Sync fork" button
            3. Click "Update branch"
            4. Then run in your local terminal:
               \`\`\`bash
               git checkout main
               git pull origin main
               git checkout ${context.payload.pull_request.head.ref}
               git merge main
               git push origin ${context.payload.pull_request.head.ref}
               \`\`\`
            
            #### Option 2: Using Git Commands
            \`\`\`bash
            # Add upstream remote (if you haven't already)
            git remote add upstream https://github.com/${context.payload.repository.full_name}.git
            
            # Fetch latest changes from upstream
            git fetch upstream
            
            # Checkout your branch
            git checkout ${context.payload.pull_request.head.ref}
            
            # Merge the latest changes from upstream/main
            git merge upstream/main
            
            # Push the updated branch
            git push origin ${context.payload.pull_request.head.ref}
            \`\`\`
