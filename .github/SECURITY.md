# Security Policy üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview

The **Algorithm & Data Structure Hub** is an open-source, educational project designed to help developers learn and practice coding concepts safely.  
While it‚Äôs not intended for production use, we still encourage responsible behavior regarding any potential security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability or a bug that may pose a risk to others:

1. **Do not disclose it publicly** in issues, comments, or pull requests.
2. Instead, please report it responsibly by:
   - Opening a **private issue**, or
   - Contacting the project maintainer directly on GitHub (`@uptouplaksh`).

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the problem (if possible).
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations.

## Response & Acknowledgement

- We aim to acknowledge valid security reports **within 48 hours**.
- If the issue is verified, we‚Äôll work on a fix or provide guidance as soon as possible.
- Contributors who report genuine vulnerabilities responsibly will be credited in our acknowledgements.

## Educational Disclaimer

This project exists for **learning and contribution purposes only**.  
It should not be used in sensitive, commercial, or production environments where data security is a concern.

Thank you for helping us keep the community safe and constructive üíô
