"""
Move Zeroes to the end of an array

A Python program to move all zeroes in a list to the end
while keeping the order of the other (non-zero) elements the same.

This operation is done in-place, meaning we modify the same list
instead of creating a new one.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

    Moves all zeros in the given list to the end, in-place.

    Parameters:
        nums (list): A list of integers (can contain zeros and non-zeros)

    Returns:
        None: The list is modified directly (no new list is returned)

    # where the next non-zero element should go.
