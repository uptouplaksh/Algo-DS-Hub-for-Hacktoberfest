Quick Sort Algorithm Implementation

Quick Sort is a highly efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy.
It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays,
according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(nÂ²) - occurs when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element

Space Complexity:
- O(log n) - due to the recursive call stack

Key Features:
- In-place sorting algorithm
- Unstable sort (doesn't preserve the relative order of equal elements)
- Efficient for large datasets
- Can be optimized for different types of input data
