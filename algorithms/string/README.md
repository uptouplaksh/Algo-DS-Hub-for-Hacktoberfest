# String Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various string manipulation and processing algorithms in different programming languages.

## Overview

String algorithms are fundamental techniques for processing, analyzing, and manipulating text data. These algorithms are essential in many applications including text editors, search engines, DNA sequence analysis, and data compression.

## Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Palindrome Checker
**Directory:** `palindrome/`

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "racecar", "madam").

**Implementations:**
- **Python** (`palindrome/python/palindrome.py`)
  - Checks if a given string is a palindrome
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Space Complexity: O(1)

**Use Cases:**
- Text validation
- Pattern recognition
- Linguistic analysis

### 2. String Reversal
**Directory:** `reverse/`

Reverses the order of characters in a string.

**Implementations:**
- **JavaScript** (`reverse/javascript/ReverseString.js`)
  - Reverses a string by iterating through characters
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Space Complexity: O(n)

**Use Cases:**
- Data transformation
- Text processing
- Algorithm building blocks

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of new string algorithms or improvements to existing implementations!

### Suggested Algorithms to Add:
- Anagram checker
- Longest common substring
- String pattern matching (KMP, Boyer-Moore)
- Levenshtein distance (edit distance)
- String compression
- Caesar cipher

### Contribution Guidelines:
1. Create a new directory for your algorithm
2. Organize by programming language
3. Include clear variable names and documentation
4. Add time and space complexity analysis in comments
5. Follow the existing project structure

## Language Support

Current implementations are available in:
- Python
- JavaScript

We encourage implementations in other languages like C++, Java, Go, Rust, etc.
